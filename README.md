# Title: Family and Pet Photography Website

## Description: This is a website meant to cater to clients who have a new or small buisness involving taking photos of familes and pets, allowing them to publish their previous work in a gallery for buyers to view, and giving buyers a way to choose different photo packages/sessions to see what works best for them!

## Within the gallery, the buyer can click on a type of photo that they enjoy the asthetic of, and it will bring them to a specific session type that follows that asthetic and is available for purchase!

## There are also options to be able to post certain themed events or deals, with date ranges, pricing, and if the event is still currently available!

### Extras: There is a bi-direction relation between the Gallery and Session content types. They are used to link a specific photo from the gallery to a session type. Since a session type can have many photos, but a gallery can only have one type of session, it is a one-to-many relation.
